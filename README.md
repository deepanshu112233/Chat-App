# HelloBuddy

Created a Chat Room where a User can login or register, upload,edit their profile photo with the help of
Django administration. The user after login can create different rooms and start a discussion on topic
which is made public so that other users can also post comments on the discussion and see recent
activity of anyone. The room can be deleted or updated by the host. The user can also join any room and
be the part of a discussion.
